//this is working except packet counter isn't setup correctly. follow example again or loot at v40-ish version
//intervals are set too short, just for testing
The Feather 32u4 Radio uses the extra space left over to add an RFM9x LoRa 433 or 868/915 MHz radio module. 
These radios are not good for transmitting audio or video, but they do work quite well for small data packet transmission 
when you need more range than 2.4 GHz (BT, BLE, WiFi, ZigBee)

SX1272 LoRaÂ® based module with SPI interface, Packet radio with ready-to-go Arduino libraries
Uses the amateur or license-free ISM bands: 433MHz is ITU "Europe" license-free ISM or ITU "American" 
amateur with limitations. 900MHz is license free ISM for ITU "Americas"
+5 to +20 dBm - up to 100 mW Power Output Capability (power output selectable in software)
~300uA during full sleep, ~120mA peak during +20dBm transmit, ~40mA during active radio listening.
Simple wire antenna or spot for uFL connector
Our initial tests with default library settings: over 1.2mi/2Km line-of-sight with wire quarter-wave antennas. 
(With setting tweaking and directional antennas, 20Km is possible)

This is the general purpose I/O pin set for the microcontroller. All logic is 3.3V

#0 / RX - GPIO #0, also receive (input) pin for Serial1 and Interrupt #2
#1 / TX - GPIO #1, also transmit (output) pin for Serial1 and Interrupt #3
#2 / SDA - GPIO #2, also the I2C (Wire) data pin. There's no pull up on this pin by default so when using with I2C, 
you may need a 2.2K-10K pullup. Also Interrupt #1
#3 / SCL - GPIO #3, also the I2C (Wire) clock pin. There's no pull up on this pin by default so when using with I2C, 
you may need a 2.2K-10K pullup. Can also do PWM output and act as Interrupt #0.
#5 - GPIO #5, can also do PWM output
#6 - GPIO #6, can also do PWM output and analog input A7
#9 - GPIO #9, also analog input A9 and can do PWM output. This analog input is connected to a voltage divider for the 
lipoly battery so be aware that this pin naturally 'sits' at around 2VDC due to the resistor divider
#10 - GPIO #10, also analog input A10 and can do PWM output.
#11 - GPIO #11, can do PWM output.
#12 - GPIO #12, also analog input A11 and can do PWM output.
#13 - GPIO #13, can do PWM output and is connected to the red LED next to the USB jack
A0 thru A5 - These are each analog input as well as digital I/O pins.
SCK/MOSI/MISO - These are the hardware SPI pins, used by the RFM radio module too! You can use them as everyday GPIO pins 
if you don't activate the radio and keep the RFM CS pin high. However, we really recommend keeping them free as they should 
be kept available for the radio module. If they are used, make sure its with a device that will kindly share the SPI bus! 
Also used to reprogram the chip with an AVR programmer if you need.
Since not all pins can be brought out to breakouts, due to the small size of the Feather, 
we use these to control the radio module

#8 - used as the radio CS (chip select) pin
#7 - used as the radio GPIO0 / IRQ (interrupt request) pin.
#4 - used as the radio Reset pin
Other Pins!
RST - this is the Reset pin, tie to ground to manually reset the AVR, as well as launch the bootloader manually
ARef - the analog reference pin. Normally the reference voltage is the same as the chip logic voltage (3.3V) but if you 
need an alternative analog reference, connect it to this pin and select the external AREF in your firmware. Can't go higher than 3.3V!

During the super sleepy mode you're using only 300uA (0.3mA)!
To put the chip into ultra-low-power mode. 
Note that USB will disconnect so do this after you have done all your debugging!
While its not easy to get the exact numbers for all of what comprise 
the 300uA there are a few quiescent current items on the Feather 32u4:
    2 x 100K resistors for VBAT measurement = 25uA
    AP2112K 3.3V regulator = 55uA
    MCP73871 batt charger = up to 100uA even when no battery is connected
The rest is probably the Atmega32u4 peripherals including the brown-out 
detect and bandgap circuitry, ceramic oscillator, etc. 
According to the datasheet, with the watchdog and BrownOutDetect enabled, 
the lowest possible current is ~30uA (at 5V which is what we're testing at)
Tie En pin to ground - ENable pin
If you'd like to turn off the 3.3V regulator, you can do that with the EN(able) pin.
Simply tie this pin to Ground and it will disable the 3V regulator. 
The BAT and USB pins will still be powered

If you're running off of a battery, chances are you wanna know what the voltage is at! 
That way you can tell when the battery needs recharging. Lipoly batteries are 'maxed out' at 4.2V 
and stick around 3.7V for much of the battery life, then slowly sink down to 3.2V or so before the 
protection circuitry cuts it off. By measuring the voltage you can quickly tell when you're heading 
below 3.7V

To make this easy we stuck a double-100K resistor divider on the BAT pin, and connected it 
to D9 (a.k.a analog #7 A7). You can read this pin's voltage, then double it, to get the battery voltage.

float measuredvbat = analogRead(VBATPIN);
measuredvbat *= 2;    // we divided by 2, so multiply back
measuredvbat *= 3.3;  // Multiply by 3.3V, our reference voltage
measuredvbat /= 1024; // convert to voltage
